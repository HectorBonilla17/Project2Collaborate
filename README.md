CSC394 - Software Project

This is where our back-end code is stored. Here, you will find:
- Old Python files
- A database script written in SQL (it creates the tables in a database and fills the tables with data)
- Two scripts written in Bash (one script contains the back-end functionality and the other script runs the first script every second)
- A PHP script that works with Ajax code on the front-end to transfer data between the front-end and the back-end (data transfer implementation was unsuccessful)

# Project2Collaborate
CSC394 - Software Project

# Home
Created in software projects "CSC394" during Winter 2021 under professor Thomas Muscarello.

## Branch Structure
1. Main (Empty)
2. Front-End (Front-end code)
3. Back-End (Back-end code)
4. Krishan-Front-End (unimplemented front-end with Ajax and FTP functions) (NOT OUR FRONT-END PRODUCT, just additional functions in a testing environment)

## Description

Our project was aimed at making an alternative platform to a project-based course such as CSC394. Software projects are not very well accommodated for D2L. D2L is a great tool for courses that rely on a homework, quiz, exam assignment manner but is not a credible tool for more intricate collaborative projects. Our intention with D2L being an error-prone platform for software development projects is to create a platform that encompasses how we would like to develop software. There are various tools out there that already exist for project management although not many of them are specifically attributed to the collegiate space.
 
By taking inspiration from software development practices such as SCRUM, AGILE, Kanban, Github, and various other concepts/tools. We intend to develop a website capable of addressing such a software development oriented course so that the professor and students alike are able to organize their development process.


## Technology Stack
- HTML/JS/CSS
- JQuery/Ajax
- Python/Bash
- MS-SQL Database

## Notice

Our project was not able to pass integration-testing and as a result, our front-end and back-end were unable to connect. By the time we had found out we already had a majority of our functions programmed and it was too late to pivot so we decided to remain as such for the course. In the future we intend to much more cautious about choosing our technologies and look upon precedent projects as an example prior to development.
